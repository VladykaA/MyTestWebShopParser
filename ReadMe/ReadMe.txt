Completely agree that the parser app could be more accurate.

For instance, the name of the product (jeans, t-shirts etc) I found in the references only.
I tried to parse it with regular expressions but due to lack of time and experience I failed,
so the only right I found is to save the whole url.

Also, it is needed to add a validations and thread safe but again the time issue did not let me do that.

Anyway the task was challenging.
